### 2. Clone the Repository and Run the Script

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/arijarman/insta-message-sorter
cd insta-message-sorter
\```

### 3. Install Required Python Packages

Ensure you have `BeautifulSoup` installed:

\```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
\```

### 4. Run the Script

Make sure to keep the `messages.html` file in the same directory as `main.py`:

\```bash
python main.py
\```

### üì• Alternative Method: Manual Download

If you prefer not to use Git, you can manually download the `main.py` file:

2. Copy and paste the code into your local system.

## üìä Before and After Comparison

Below is a visual comparison of the original Instagram `messages.html` versus the chat-themed format generated by this tool:

| Original Instagram HTML                      | Chat-Themed HTML Generated by the Tool         |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ![Original HTML](https://github.image1)       | ![Chat Bubble HTML](https://github.image2)     |

## üé® How It Works

This script uses **BeautifulSoup** to parse and manipulate the HTML content:

1. **Reverses Message Order**: The script reverses the order from "newest to oldest" to "oldest to newest."
2. **Chat Bubble Format**: Applies custom CSS styles to format messages in a chat-bubble style.
3. **Timezone Conversion**: Uses Python libraries to convert timestamps from Alaska Time to your local timezone.

Simply run the Python script, and it will process all `messages.html` files in the directory!

## üí° Why Use This Tool?

Reading Instagram chat history manually is cumbersome due to its default formatting. This tool simplifies the entire process, providing a more intuitive and visually appealing format. It‚Äôs especially helpful for:

- **Journalists** or **Researchers** analyzing conversations.
- **Data Enthusiasts** exploring chat patterns.
- Anyone who wants to relive their chat moments without scrolling endlessly!
